      <p>Thank you for considering participation in this study. The primary objective of this study is to identify posture abnormalities using AI-driven technology and a goniometer. Based on your assessment, specific exercises will be recommended to improve posture, and you will be reassessed after a period of time to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions.</p>
      
      <p>Your participation in this research will involve an initial assessment to measure your posture and the range of motion at key joints. Based on the results, a physiotherapist will provide you with a customized exercise protocol to improve your posture. After completing the exercises, you will be invited for a follow-up assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the exercises and track changes in your posture over time.</p>

      <p>Your participation is voluntary, and all information provided will be kept strictly confidential. No images or videos of your posture will be stored. During the assessment, only the position of specific anatomical landmarks will be detected, and range of motion measurements will be recorded. Only the maximum values of these measurements will be stored for research and evaluation purposes. Personal information such as your name, contact details, and assessment results will not be shared or disclosed to any third party.</p>

      <p>If you have any questions regarding the study or your participation, feel free to contact:</p>
